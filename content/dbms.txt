A Database is an organized collection of related data. A Database Management System (DBMS) is the software used to manage, store, and retrieve this data, overcoming issues of older file-processing systems like data redundancy, inconsistency, and security problems.

## Database Design and Structure
ER Diagram: An Entity-Relationship diagram is a visual model of the database's logical structure. It consists of:

Entities: Real-world objects (e.g., Student). A strong entity has a primary key, while a weak entity doesn't and depends on another entity.

Attributes: Properties of an entity (e.g., Roll_no, Name). They can be simple, composite, multi-valued, derived, or key attributes.

Relationships: Associations between entities, defined by cardinality (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many).

Keys: Attributes used to uniquely identify records.

Primary Key: The main unique identifier for a record.

Foreign Key: A key used to link two tables together.

Other types include Super, Candidate, Alternate, and Composite keys.

Constraints: Rules that ensure data correctness, such as Domain, Key, and Integrity constraints.

## Normalization
Normalization is the process of organizing a database to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity. It involves dividing larger tables into smaller, well-structured ones.

1NF (First Normal Form): Ensures each cell contains a single, atomic value.

2NF (Second Normal Form): Is in 1NF and has no partial dependencies (where a non-key attribute depends on only part of a composite primary key).

3NF (Third Normal Form): Is in 2NF and has no transitive dependencies (where a non-key attribute depends on another non-key attribute).

BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form): A stricter version of 3NF where for every non-trivial functional dependency A→B, A must be a super key.

## Transactions and Concurrency
Transaction: A single logical unit of work, like transferring money. Transactions follow the ACID properties:

Atomicity: All operations complete, or none do.

Consistency: The database remains in a valid state.

Isolation: Concurrent transactions don't interfere with each other.

Durability: Committed changes are permanent.

Schedules: The order of execution for concurrent transaction operations. A serializable schedule is a non-serial (concurrent) schedule that produces the same result as some serial (one-by-one) schedule, ensuring consistency.

## Data Manipulation and File Structures
Relational Algebra: A procedural query language that uses operators like Select (σ), Project (π), Join (⋈), Union (U), and Intersection (∩) to manipulate data.

File Structures & Indexing: Methods for organizing data for efficient retrieval.

Indexes (Primary, Clustering, Secondary): Data structures that improve the speed of data retrieval operations.

B-Trees and B+ Trees: Self-balancing tree data structures used to store and retrieve data from a disk efficiently. B+ trees are commonly used in databases as they store all data in leaf nodes, allowing for faster sequential access.
