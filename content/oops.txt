Object-Oriented Programming System (OOPS)

OOPS is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects" which contain data and methods.

Key Concepts:
- Classes and Objects
- Encapsulation: Bundling data and methods
- Inheritance: Deriving new classes from existing ones
- Polymorphism: Ability to take many forms
- Abstraction: Hiding complex implementation details

OOPS helps in designing modular and reusable code.
