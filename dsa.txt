Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

Data Structures are ways to organize and store data for efficient access and modification. Algorithms are step-by-step procedures for calculations.

Common Data Structures:
- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees)
- Graphs
- Hash Tables

Common Algorithms:
- Sorting (Bubble, Merge, Quick)
- Searching (Linear, Binary)
- Graph Algorithms (DFS, BFS, Dijkstra)
- Dynamic Programming

Understanding DSA is crucial for problem-solving and optimizing code performance.
