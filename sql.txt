Structured Query Language (SQL)

SQL is a standard language for managing data held in a relational database management system.

Key Concepts:
- DDL: Data Definition Language (CREATE, ALTER, DROP)
- DML: Data Manipulation Language (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
- DCL: Data Control Language (GRANT, REVOKE)
- TCL: Transaction Control Language (COMMIT, ROLLBACK)

SQL allows users to query, insert, update, and modify data.
